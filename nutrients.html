<h1><b>Nutrients Contd.</b></h1>
<br>
<p>Your main nutrients are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nitrogen</li>
	<li>Phosphorous</li>
	<li>Potassium</li>
	<li>Calcium</li>
	<li>Magnesium</li>
	<li>Sulfur</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>These nutrients are called macronutrients. There are other micro or trace nutrients, but it is unlikely they will have a major effect on the health of your plants. The most important of the macronutrients are Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium. The balance between these tell the plant whether to create new vegetative growth or to flower and produce fruit. In general, high nitrogen means leafy, vegetative growth and high potassium and phosphorous means flowering. This is called the "NPK" balance, after the chemical symbols of the nutrients.</p>
