<p>Hydroponic growing does not involve the use of soil. Soild is replaced with a substrate. A substrate is nothing more or less than the material your plant puts it's roots in.</p>

<header>Lights</header>
<p>Because you are likely growing indoors, you'll also need to provide artificial lighting. If you are growing in a greenhouse environment with access to sunlight, you can ignore this section.</p>
<header><center><i>Types of Lights</i></center></header>
<img src="highpressure.jpeg" alt="High Pressure Sodium Bulb" style="vertical-align:middle">
<ul>
	<li>High Pressure Sodium</li>
	<li>Metal Halide</li>
	<li>LED</li>
	<li>Traditional Incandescant</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>All of these kinds of lights have different advantages and disadvantages, though unless you are under tight fiscal constraints you should avoid incandescant lighting. It tends to provide very little of the spectrum of light you need. If energy costs are a concern, LEDs will provide the lowest electrical usage. These will cost the most up front cost however.</p>

<header><center><b>Nutrients</b></center></header>
<br>
<p>Because there is no soild in hydroponic growing, you will need to provide nutrients using a nutrient solution. You can spend a lot of time and effort making your own, but unless you have degrees in biology and chemistry, I wouldn't bother. It's much more efficient to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/General-Hydroponics-MaxiGro-Gardening-2-2-Pound/dp/B00NQANQAC"purchase></a> a commercial hydroponic nutrient solution. Check to make sure that it provides all the nutrients necessary for the plant you are attempting to grow and that the ph balance is within a tolerable range for your plant.</p>
